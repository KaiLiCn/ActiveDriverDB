**How to test**

Tests are compatibile with both nose and pytest, but pytest does not require extra configuration to start.

To run tests with pytest, type:
```bash
~/website$ python3 -m pytest
```


**Tools installation**

Both nose and pytests are not installed by default. To get them, use pip3:

```bash
pip3 install nose pytest
```
